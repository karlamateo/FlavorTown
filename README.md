My project is a two player game that can be won by lining up your designated shape in a 3-in-a-row format.
A win can be lined up horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

It indicates the next persons turn by alternating between shapes in a "hover" state before they choose the tile they want to place their shape on.

unsolved problems
reset button wont work - you have to refresh the page/game manually.
