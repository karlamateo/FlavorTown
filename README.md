# TicTacGeo
My project has the ability to run an entire game of tic-tac-toe.
It indicates the next persons turn by alternating between shapes in a "hover" state before they choose the tile they want to place their shape on.

unsolved problems
reset button wont work - you have to refresh the page/game manually.
